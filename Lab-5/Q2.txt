(select N as Node, 'Root' as Type
from Q2
where P is null)
union
(select N as Node, 'Leaf' as Type
from Q2
where N not in (select distinct P
        from Q2
        where P is not null) 
    and P is not null)
union
(select N as Node, 'Inner' as Type
from Q2
where N in (select distinct P
        from Q2
        where P is not null)
    and P is not null)
order by Node;
